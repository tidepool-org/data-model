### type

[ingestion, storage, client] The string `bolus`.

	QUICK SUMMARY
	Required:
		jellyfish: yes
		platform: yes

### subType

[ingestion, storage, client] The string `square`.

	QUICK SUMMARY
	Required:
		jellyfish: yes
		platform: yes

#### Changelog for `subType`

`_schemaVersion` ? (future): We plan to migrate from `square` to `extended` in the future.

<!-- start editable commentary on subType -->

This is the sub-type of `bolus` event that represents a bolus insulin dose programmed to be delivered spread evenly over a `duration` of time (typically fifteen minutes to several hours).

We plan to migrate all Tidepool data to use `extended` as the value of this sub-type rather than `square` in order to improve the consistency of the data model. With `subType` containing `extended` and the `extended` field containing the value of the delivered insulin dose, this sub-type of `bolus` event will be parallel to `normal` boluses, where the `subType` is `normal` and the `normal` field contains the value of the delivered insulin dose.

### extended

[ingestion, storage, client] A floating point value representing units of insulin.

	QUICK SUMMARY
	Required:
		jellyfish: yes
		platform: yes
	Numerical type: Floating point value rounded to the appropriate significant figures for the device's precision.
	Range:
		min: >= 0.0
		max: 100.0

<!-- start editable commentary on extended -->

The `extended` field encodes the numerical value of the dose of insulin delivered over the `duration` by an insulin pump. As with `normal` boluses, we do not allow the upload of boluses with a total delivered dose of 0 units.

Refer to the documentation for [`normal`](normal.md) boluses for an explanation of the range of this field.

### expectedExtended

> This field is **optional**.

[ingestion, storage, client] A floating point value representing units of insulin.

	QUICK SUMMARY
	Required:
		jellyfish: no (optional)
		platform: no (optional)
	Numerical type: Floating point value rounded to the appropriate significant figures for the device's precision.
	Range:
		min: > `extended`
		max: 100.0

<!-- start editable commentary on expectedExtended -->

When a `square` bolus is interrupted (for example, by an occlusion or pump malfunction) or canceled by the user, the `expectedExtended` field is used to store the original value of the dose of insulin that the user programmed, while `extended` represents the value of the dose that was actually delivered.

Refer to the documentation for [`normal`](normal.md) boluses for an explanation of the range of this field.

### duration

[ingestion, storage, client] An integer value representing a duration of time in milliseconds.

	QUICK SUMMARY
	Required:
		jellyfish: yes
		platform: yes
	Numerical type: Integer value representing milliseconds.
	Range:
		min: 0
		max: 86400000

<!-- start editable commentary on duration -->

The `duration` field encodes the actual elapsed duration of time, in milliseconds, spent delivering the dose of insulin encoded in `extended`.

<!-- DRAFT: discuss with Gerrit -->
The user interface for some insulin pumps allows a user to program a `square` bolus with a 0 duration; this is logically equivalent to a `normal` bolus but in order to expose device data with the highest level of fidelity possible, we preserve the record as a sub-type `square` and allow the upload of the event with a value of 0 for `duration`.

To the best of our knowledge, no insulin pump allows the programming of a `square` bolus with a duration longer than twenty-four hours, and so we have chosen this as the maximum value accepted by the new platform APIs.

### expectedDuration

> This field is **optional**.

[ingestion, storage, client] An integer value representing an original programmed duration of time in milliseconds when the programmed event did not complete due to interruption or user cancellation.

	QUICK SUMMARY
	Required:
		jellyfish: no (optional)
		platform: no (optional)
	Numerical type: Integer value representing milliseconds.
	Range:
		min: >= `duration`
		max: 86400000

<!-- start editable commentary on expectedDuration -->

When a `square` bolus is interrupted (for example, by an occlusion or pump malfunction) or canceled by the user, the `expectedDuration` field is used to store the original duration of time that the user programmed for delivery of the dose of insulin encoded in `extended`. The `duration` field, in contrast, encodes the actual elapsed duration of dose delivery.

The minimum value of `expectedDuration` is any value greater than or equal to that encoded under `duration` since any other value (i.e., less than `duration`) cannot obtain from interruption or cancellation of a bolus. Note that the `expectedDuration` can only be *equal* to the `duration` in the very rare and special case that the `duration` is 0. See above under [`duration`](#duration) for discussion of the minimum and maximum values for this field.
