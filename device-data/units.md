## Units

In general, the Tidepool platform does not mutate data. Rather, data is read from diabetes devices (or other sources of diabetes device data) and stored in a form as close as possible to the <!-- Edit by Eden --> original while still achieving the translation into the standardized Tidepool data model(s).

An exception is made, however, for blood glucose data. Tidepool has chosen to store blood glucose data in `mmol/L` units *only*. Tidepool chose `mmol/L` because it is the standard for international research and because, as a floating point number, it can be converted accurately to `mg/dL`, which is typically an integer. The reverse <!-- Edit by Eden --> is not true.

Event types that include a blood glucose value or blood glucose-related value (such as an insulin sensitivity factor (ISF) expressed in units of blood glucose per unit of insulin) must also have a `units` field specified - either `mg/dL` or `mmol/L`. When that field is `mg/dL`, upon ingestion of the event through [the Tidepool data ingestion API](https://github.com/tidepool-org/jellyfish) the value is converted to `mmol/L`, the `units` field updated accordingly, and then the event is stored.

> While it may seem that information is being *lost* through Tidepool's not storing the original (input) units of any blood glucose(-related) value, this is in fact not the case. Many diabetes devices store blood glucose(-related) values in `mg/dL` even when they are set to *display* these values in `mmol/L`. In other words, the original units of a blood glucose(-related) value are arbitary, not reliable as an indicator of the units a user would prefer to see his or her blood glucose(-related) values displayed in, and thus provide little to no value for data-auditing purposes.

The algorithm followed for conversion of blood glucose(-related) values <!-- Edit by Eden --> by Tidepool from `mg/dL` to `mmol/L` is:

1. If `units` field is `mg/dL`...
1. Divide the value by `18.01559` ([the molar mass of glucose is 180.1559](http://www.convertunits.com/molarmass/Glucose 'Reference: molar mass of glucose'))
1. Store the resulting floating-point precision value without any rounding or truncation
